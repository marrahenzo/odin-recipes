    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An easy homemade Carrot Cake recipe for a super moist cake made from
      scratch. This traditional carrot cake is tender and perfectly spiced, with
      balanced sweetness. This southern carrot cake recipe is sinfully
      delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cake is perfectly spiced, light and moist. The thing I really love
      about this recipe is how easy it is to make. The last thing I want to do
      in summer in the south is bake a cake that requires a lot of work. This
      cake â€” doesn't require a lot of work, it's great to toss in the oven with
      dinner. This recipe has everything I look for in a good cake. It's moist,
      has great texture and has a wonderful balance of sweetness and spices.
