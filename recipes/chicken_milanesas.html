        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken milanesa is a simple dish, but one of the most delicious
            lunchtime staples in Spain. Just take thin fillets of chicken
            breast, coat them in breadcrumbs, and fry them in a shallow pan.
            Usually served alongside a fresh garden salad, rice, boiled
            potatoes, or homemade french fries, this is one hearty dish!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil canola works too</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To prepare the chicken, slice each of the breasts crosswise into
                two thin fillets. Place in a zip-lock bag and bash with a meat
                tenderizer or rolling pin to flatten out to about a 1/4-inch
                thickness.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Take two medium-sized kitchen bowls. In the first, beat the egg.
                In the second, combine the breadcrumbs with the garlic, pepper,
                and salt.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Dip each chicken fillet in the egg, then in the breadcrumb mix,
                and then place on a plate ready to fry.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                To fry the chicken, place a large skillet over medium heat and
                add the vegetable oil. When the oil is shimmering, fry the
                chicken fillets for about 5 minutes on each side without
                crowding the pan (you might only be able to do 1 or 2 at a time
                depending on the size of the skillet). Place chicken on a plate
                that has been covered with a paper towel to drain any excess
                oil.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Serve hot, with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
